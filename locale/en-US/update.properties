title= Bookmark Tags Is Now TagSifter
message= Thanks for updating Bookmark Tags.  Firefox 3 includes tagging built-in, so the folder-based system of Bookmark Tags is no longer needed (yay!).  To reflect this shift in focus, Bookmark Tags has been renamed TagSifter.  You can convert your folders into Firefox 3 tags by using the migration wizard, which is accessed from the Tools menu, TagSifter's options window, and the button below.
